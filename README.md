- **Security Features**: Supports OAuth2.0, JWT, Basic Authentication, mutual SSL, and other security protocols.
- **Traffic Management**: Offers rate limiting, throttling, and load balancing for high-traffic scenarios.
- **Analytics and Monitoring**: Provides insights into API usage, traffic trends, and error tracking with real-time monitoring capabilities.

## Usage Examples
### Example 1: Publishing a New API
1. Log in to the admin console.
2. Click "Add New API" and provide the basic details.
3. Configure security settings (OAuth, API Key, etc.).
4. Publish the API and make it available on the Developer Portal.

### Example 2: Securing an API with OAuth2
1. Go to the APIâ€™s settings in the admin console.
2. Enable OAuth2 under the security tab.
3. Configure scopes and policies for fine-grained access control.

### Example 3: Setting Up Rate Limiting
1. Define a throttling policy in the admin console.
2. Apply the policy to the desired API to limit the number of requests per minute.

## Advanced Configuration
### Customizing the API Gateway
- **Message Transformation**: Use the built-in scripting capabilities (JavaScript, Velocity templates) to transform request and response messages.
- **Custom Error Handling**: Define custom error messages and handling strategies for different types of errors (e.g., 404 Not Found, 500 Server Error).

### Integration with External Services
- **Connecting to Databases**: Configure the API Manager to connect to external databases for storing analytics, logs, and user data.
- **Identity Providers**: Integrate with Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions, such as Okta or Keycloak, for centralized authentication.

## Monitoring and Analytics
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track API calls, response times, and error rates in real-time dashboards.
- **Custom Reports**: Generate reports for API usage statistics, traffic patterns, and compliance with Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Configure alerts for threshold violations and automatically send notifications via email or webhooks.
